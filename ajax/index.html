  "content": "<h1>Idio Web Server In Node.JS</h1>\n\nThe <em>Idio</em> web server is a distribution of the Koa2 web server with strategic middleware. It has been compiled to not include any 3rd party dependencies, ie., after installing this package, there will be only 1 more dependency in <span class=\"tm\">node_modules</span> (mime-db). This is achieved with the work done of annotating the Koa2-infrastructure for Closure Compiler, and using it to create a single library file.\n\nThe annotations are written as JSDoc and don't include Typings, but the context property is accessed in the middleware. However, they include the <span class=\"tm\">import</span> statements, because this package was written for VSCode (or other editors that support TypeScript type syntax). Typings are too technological and contradict the purpose of the <em>Idio</em> web server which to be use pure JavaScript in building great <em>Node.JS</em> applications.\n\n<img alt=\"Idio Web Server With Session And Custom Middleware With Access To Context Autocompletion.\" io data-src=\"img/idio.gif\">\n<noscript><img alt=\"Idio Web Server With Session And Custom Middleware With Access To Context Autocompletion.\" src=\"img/idio.gif\"></noscript>\n\n<p>\n  The use-cases that can be achieved with the middleware include:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"session.html\">Session management</a></li>\n  <li>Multipart/form-data form submission and file upload</li>\n  <li>Serving static pages</li>\n  <li>Enabling compression</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/0.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\"></a>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\nThis is introduction.\n\n<p class=\"SectionBreak\">\n  <a title=\"Back To Top\" href=\"#top\">\n    <img src=\"section-breaks/1.svg\" alt=\"Back To Top\"></a>\n</p>",
